# Project 3 - Experiment Phase

## Methods

We conducted experiments with 10 participants and they can exercise the three [rights](./phase3trials.md#rights of-the-participants). Web based user friendly approach, similar to HW3, was used for the human trials. Participants were provided with token via email/slack during the start of the session, and asked to log in to the web page. The 1st page was a pre-experiment survey, to gauge the user comfort with using git. The next page had links to the [tasks](./phase3trials.md#Experiment) and two timers to record the the total time taken to complete the tasks using GITS and git. Finally, participants filled a post experiment [questionairre](https://forms.gle/cvH3f6aYvojgsyVv5).

## Materials

We reserved VCL machine and had setup the environment for the experiment over it. The test repositories were already cloned, one for GITS and other for git. The setup instructions used were uniform for everyone and are listed [here](./phase3trials.md#vcl-steps). As VCL was reserved on admin's username, the participants were provided access to the VCL machine with a modified password.
